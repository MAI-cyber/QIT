# QIT

Quantum Information Science and Technologies Repository


This repository contains Python code implementations of various quantum algorithms used in quantum information science. The code examples provided here include implementations of the Grover search algorithm, quantum counting, quantum phase estimation, Shor's factoring algorithm, quantum Fourier transform, and more.

These codes were generated for a graduate level course and are indended to to aid new students develop their grasp on qiskit, quantum computing and quantum algorithms.
